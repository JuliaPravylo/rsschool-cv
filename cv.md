## About Me:

I'm Julia. At RS School, I am taking the first steps in front-end development. 
After working for 10 years in my profession, I realized that I do not see my future in it. It is difficult to devote your time to what is of no value to others. I have achieved leadership and respect due to my perseverance and love of learning.
With the advent of my daughter, I rethought many aspects of life. So I decided to try to master web development.
Strengths:
- Able to independently make decisions. 
- Like to analyze, optimize and structure. 
- Prefer to understand deeply the work I do. 
- Can handle with tools and know how to “google”.
- Ability to work both individually and as a team member.
***

## Skills and Proficiency:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Editors: Sublime, VS Code
- Figma, Avocode
- JS (in process)
- Git&Github

***

## Code example:
Write code that prints all prime numbers from 2 to n.

let n = 10;

nextPrime:
for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) { 

  for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) { 
    if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime;
  }

  alert( i );
}
